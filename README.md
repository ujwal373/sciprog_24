## Introduction

Welcome to my Git Assignment Project for ICHEC (Irish Centre for High-End Computing) for the academic year 2024-2025. This repository, named **sciprog_24**, serves as the central location for my practical assignments, where I will demonstrate my understanding and application of concepts in scientific programming, primarily using the C language.

Each practical assignment is organized on a separate branch to maintain a clean and structured workflow. This setup allows for easy code management, version control, and cross-verification of expected outputs.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a structured organization, with each practical assignment residing in its own branch. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- **Main Branch**: Contains the primary `README.md` file and general documentation.
- **Practical Branches**: Each practical assignment is on its own branch, labeled as `practical-<number>`. These branches contain:
  - Source code files for each specific practical, written in C language.
  - A `README.md` file detailing how to compile, run, and verify the code.

For example:
- `practical-2`
  - `README.md` (Instructions for practical assignment 2)
  - `main.c` (Code for practical assignment 2)

## How to Run Each Practical

Each `README.md` file within the practical branches provides detailed instructions on how to:
1. Compile the code using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection).
2. Run the executable.
3. Verify the output against the expected results.
